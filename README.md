This is a web application used to create and monitor or simulate a Fantasy Football season.
The database and statistics are scrubbed from NFL.com and currently utilizes data up to September 2014.

An auto draft system is in place in case the user does not wish to pick their own teams.
This chooses the best player available based on total points earned in the last season.

The site is currently set up to monitor a group of 8 fantasy teams per league.
